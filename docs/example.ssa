a<-expression   Evaluates expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a.

DISPLAY(expression)     Displays the value of expression, followed by a space.

INPUT()     Accepts a value from the user and returns the input value.

a+b     The arithmetic operators +, -, *, and / are used to perform arithmetic on a and b.
a-b     For example, 17 / 5 evaluates to 3.4.
a*b     The order of operations used in mathematics applies when evaluating expressions.
a/b

a MOD b     Evaluates to the remainder when a is divided by b.
            Assume that a is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and b is an integer greater than 0.

RANDOM(a, b)    Generates and returns a random integer from a to b, including a and b.
                Each result is equally likely to occur.

a=b     The relational operators =, ≠, >, <, ≥, and ≤ are used to test the relationship between two variables, expressions, or values.
a≠b     A comparison using relational operators evaluates to a Boolean value.
a>b     For example, a = b evaluates to true if a and b are equal;otherwise it evaluates to false.
a<b
a≥b
a≤b

NOT condition   Evaluates to true if condition is false; otherwise evaluates to false.
condition1 AND condition2   Evaluates to true if both condition1 and condition2 are true; otherwise evaluates to false.

The code in block of statements is executed if the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true;
no action is taken if condition evaluates to false.
IF(condition){
    <block of statements>
}

The code in first block of statements is executed
if the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true;
otherwise the code in second block of statements is executed.
IF(condition){
    <first block of statements>
}
ELSE{
    <second block of statements>
}
